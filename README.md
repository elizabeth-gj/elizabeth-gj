## Hello 🙋‍♀️

I'm Elizabeth, a commercial analyst showcasing here my learnings on developing Data Viz, SQL and Python skills. 

- I've been working in e-commerce for 8 years for direct-to-customer brands.
- I really love working and thinking about customer's commercials: retention, subscription management, lifetime value, engagement, product adoption.
- I also am excited when working as an intermediary in between the data and the people, trying to enable more data-literacy, self-serve and more optimised processes with teams I work with.
